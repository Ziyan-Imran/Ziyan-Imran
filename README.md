- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ziyan-Imran
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge of langauges and frameworks. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my skills in full-stack using JS/CSS/HTML with additions such as Bootstrap/Tailwind for the front-end, Python/Rust for back-end langauges, and using PostgresSQL as a database. Additionally, I'm integrating common CI/CD practices to keep a streamlined DevOps cycle.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation projects.
- My language proficiences are in Python and Rust with frameworks like Flask and Django.
